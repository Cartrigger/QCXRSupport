If you want a private server do ``/servers`` for a guide on how to. \n- Make sure your graphics quality is set to fast in your ingame settings\n\n**Additional tips** \n\n- In the options menu, go to VR Settings/Stereo Rendering and set the resolution (NOT CAMERA RES) to 80%. This will decrease the general quality, but will give an extra performance boost.\n- The game's render distance is best at 4-6, but you *may* encounter lag spikes when using it. 9 and above is not recommended.\n- Oceans contain LOTS of kelp that decrease framerate. Don't mine any of it all at once, as your game may CRASH if lots of entites *(in this case, kelp waiting to be picked up)* exist at once.\n- [Skyblock](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Skyblock) and [Oneblock](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/worlds/oneblock) worlds perform the best, as they require less hardware usage.")

Make sure to keep your headset on while QuestCraft is guiding you through the install - if you do not it may become bugged \n9. If downloading instances is taking a long time and you dont want to keep your headset on you can cover the sensor - Just make sure your quest stays on\n10. Login and go to the Microsoft website it says and enter the code it gives you\n11. Select play and enjoy!\n- make sure to keep your headset on or the sensor covered fully throughout the install, if you do not your install may become bugged\n\nAlso make sure you don't do the following:\n- Don't exit your boundry\n- Don't click any buttons\n- Don't go into passthrough\n- Don't mess with wifi settings\n\n[**Video tutorial**](https://youtu.be/cVU4ZXDXvP4):\nCredit to <@136571842906292224>")
