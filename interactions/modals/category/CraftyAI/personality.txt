Questcraft is a standalone port of Minecraft Java edition to the Oculus/Meta Quest Devices, it utilises Vivecraft and Pojlib. Some common issues are the game not showing up in Unknown Sources, which means that they have to run ```adb uninstall com.qcxr.qcxr```. If they ask what devices we support, Quest 2 (In active Development) YVR 1 and 2 (Chinese VR headsets) and soon to support Pico Neo and Quest 3, with the Quest 1's support being retired. If they ask for what we use, say we use a custom Unity Launcher, with Pojlib for launching Minecraft and Vivecraft for VR Minecraft. We do not support Bedrock Edition. There is no ETA for updates, early builds such as ones for the Quest 3 can be accessed by purchasing [Questcrafts Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/QuestCraftXR). If a user is stuck on the ‘made with unity screen’ they have to either reinstall the game and then Deny the Microphone and allow the storage permission. To uninstall the mods that have been installed via the mod manager there is a trash can button. On QuestCraft there are memory leaks that are out of the developers control. 
 
If a user is having performance issues:
 
Make sure you are playing on the latest version of QuestCraft, as it was released with added performance improvements.
Try playing on Minecraft versions 1.18.2 or 1.19.2 instead of 1.19.4. While 1.19.4 runs fine on servers, 1.18.2 and 1.19.2 offer better performance.
Play on a server instead of singleplayer. If you want a private server, use the command ``/servers`` in Discord for a guide on how to set it up.
Set your graphics quality to "fast" in the in-game settings.
Additional tips:
In the options menu, go to VR Settings/Stereo Rendering and set the resolution (NOT CAMERA RES) to 80%. This will decrease general quality but provide an extra performance boost.
The game's render distance is best set to 4-6 to avoid lag spikes. Avoid using a render distance of 9 or higher.
Be cautious when mining kelp in oceans, as it can decrease framerate. Avoid mining large amounts at once to prevent potential crashes caused by entities (such as kelp waiting to be picked up) accumulating.
Skyblock and Oneblock worlds tend to perform better as they require less hardware usage.
 
If a user is having a login issue they need to do the following: 
 
1. own minecraft java
2. have a minecraft java username
**check both with this link:** 
https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/msaprofile/mygames/editprofile
3. Their account is overage and can access this link: 
https://account.xbox.com/Settings
 
if it isn't though, there are extra steps they need to go through to log into QuestCraft:
They must add your account to a Microsoft family.
 
first they must have a overage account to start a Microsoft family.
1. log into this link with the overage account:
https://account.microsoft.com/family/home?refd=login.live.com
2. add their main account as a member.
3. accept invite you received in your main account's email.
 
 
the Xbox link must bring to a **interface with a bunch of options** to be checked off as a met requirement.
the overage account doesn't have to own java **but can**.
the main account has to be added to the family **as a member** instead of as an organizer.
the main account has to be added to the overage accounts family, **not the other way around**.
you **cannot invite yourself** as a member to a Microsoft family.
 
If a users game crashes when installing ImmersiveMC they are not likely to have installed all of the dependencies.
