# QCXRsoonbot
A shitty bot made in JS
Atleast this doesn't suck the most.

You can see I suck at this and shouldn't be doing this :>


How to setup this bot:
First: Set config.json to your information.
Second: Run (node deploy-commands.js)
Final: Run index.js

To remove commands:
Get command ID's
Remove it by putting command ID's in 'YOURCMDIDHERE' in remove-commands.js
