This will decrease the general quality, but will give an extra performance boost.\n- The game's render distance is best at 4-6, but you *may* encounter lag spikes when using it. 9 and above is not reccomended.\n- Oceans contain LOTS of kelp that decrease framerate. Don't mine any of it all at once, as your game may CRASH if lots of entites *(in this case, kelp waiting to be picked up)* exist at once.\n- [Skyblock](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Skyblock) and [Oneblock](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/worlds/oneblock) worlds perform the best, as they require less hardware usage.")
