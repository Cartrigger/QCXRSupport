# When contributing you must:

- NOT MAKE HUGE FILES (such as 1000 lines)

- TALK AS THE BOT (such as in commands)

- If a embed already exists, import it using ```const embed_reinstall = ("PATH HERE")```, the path can be ```../../slash/ping.js```. 

- Make sure it doesn't crash

- If it's not a draft, make sure it works

- Do not modify core parts unless needed (bot.js, config.json example)
