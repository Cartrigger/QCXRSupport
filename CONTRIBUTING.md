# When contributing you must:

- Not make huge files (such as 1000 lines)

- Talk like the bot (such as in commands)

- If a embed already exists, import it using ```const embed_reinstall = ("PATH HERE")```, the path can be ```../../slash/ping.js```. 

- Make sure it doesn't crash (if its not a draft)

- If it's not a draft, make sure it works

- Do not modify core parts unless needed (bot.js, config.json example)

- Add any reasons for the PR.
