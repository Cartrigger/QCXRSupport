# Markdown Guidelines
## Markdown Document Information:
Markdown documents in this bot are loaded dynamically from the repo. This allows for easy updating of markdown, but comes with the caviat that some things are no longer able to be accessed, such as icon settings, image setting, or other. This can be added manually via a direct edit to the JavaScript, but that requires a bot update for it to be changed.
## Guidelines for Markdown
Markdown must be written in the same format as Discord, as the preview window will always show different compared to discord, as Discord does not use line breaks and only uses enter as a new line start. On top of that, it must be English USA.
