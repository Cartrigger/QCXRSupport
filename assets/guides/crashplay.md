*Solution is for those that haven't added any extra mods than the default ones*

❌  **You most likely got an interrupted download**
*easiest way to solve this is to reinstall the instance*

🟣 **Step by step**🟣
**In instances**
- Delete the instance (Could be version number)
- Create a new instance (Not needed if you want to use default mods / performance modpack)

**Playscreen**
- Choose that instance or version
- Press play
- Wait until the text in the lower right corner have disappeared
- Wait around 1 minute **after** it has disappeared
- Then press play

⚠️ **Don’t remove your headset during the whole download!**⚠️

🟣 **Other things will stop the download:**🟣
• letting the headset go idle
• exiting your guardian
• clicking any buttons in the app
• going into passthrough
• messing with wifi settings
• quitting the app

ℹ️ **Additional info**
Average completion time is 2-20 minutes but it depends on your internet speed.
• The file size is around 700 megabytes
- 1.18 doesn't work
    *(Removed in 6.0)*

- 1.19.4 is currently bugged.
   *(It is fixed on the current __patreon build__ and will be fixed when 6.0 launch)*

- Until release of 6.0
  You can still play 1.19.4 **IF** you remove Sodium.**
   (Though you may get worse performance)

*Alternatively, if you know how to build Sodium yourself, you can do that after applying our patch. But we won’t assist with it.*
