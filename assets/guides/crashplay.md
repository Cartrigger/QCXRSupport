- 1.18 doesn't work

- 1.19.4 is currently bugged.
  *(It is fixed on the current __patreon build__ and will be fixed when 5.1.0 launch)*

- Until release of 5.1.0
  You can still play 1.19.4 **IF** you remove sodium.**
  (Though you will get worse performance)

*Alternatively, if you know how to build sodium yourself, you can do that. But we won’t assist with it*
